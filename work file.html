   <h1>Gameplay</h1>

   In Brawl Stars, players battle against other players or AI opponents in multiple game modes. Players can choose between characters called Brawlers that they have unlocked through Boxes, the Brawl Pass, the Trophy Road, or purchased through the Shop to use in battles.[6] In December 2022, Boxes were removed, and all previous methods to get them were replaced with credits and chroma credits, which are used to unlock Brawlers, who are now mostly placed on the "Starr Road".[7]
   
   Brawl Stars has a variety of different game modes that players can choose from, each one having a different objective. Players can invite friends to play with them up to the maximum team size of the game mode.[8][9]
   
   In addition, it is possible to purchase skins with Gems, Star Points, and Coins, or unlock them through the Brawl Pass, which will alter the appearance, animations, effects, and/or sounds of Brawlers.[6][10]
   
   Brawl Pass
   In May 2020, a game update added a new reward system called “Brawl Pass”. The Brawl Pass is the game's version of a battle pass. When players compete in battles, they earn Tokens to progress along the Brawl Pass, which the tokens required would exponentially increase per Brawl Pass level. Players can earn credits, chroma credits, Gems, skins, Pins (emojis that can be used during battles or in a team game room), Coins, Power Points, and Brawlers from the pass. There are two types of Brawl Pass. All players have the free Brawl Pass by default. Players can purchase the premium Brawl Pass with Gems.[11]
   
   Power League
   Power League is a competitive ranking system added to the game in season 5. This replaced the Power Play system. Players unlock this system at 4500 trophies. There are a total of 19 ranks between bronze one and master. Each season lasts two months. At the end of a Power League season, players gain Star Points based on their rank.[12]
   
   Players can enter Power League solo or with teams of three. The winner is decided on a best-of-three format and ties do not count. Each match starts the game randomly choosing a game mode and map. All players from both teams choose a Brawler to ban. All six players in the match must play with a different Brawler. Players in the team can switch Brawlers with each other if they have the specific Brawler unlocked. Progression is varied based on various factors including the opponents ranks.[12]
   
   Club League
   Club League was introduced in season 9 as a new weekly competition between Clubs, where eight Clubs compete during the days Wednesday, Friday and Sunday of the week. Tickets are required to play matches. 4 tickets are given on Wednesday and Friday, with 6 tickets given on Sunday. Clubs compete to gain the most Club Trophies possible by players playing in selected matches. Players who play with other Club members are rewarded by earning more Club Trophies for the club. After each competing day, the Clubs are ranked based on the club's Trophies to earn Club Points.[13]
   
   When the league ends on every Monday, the Clubs are ranked based on the club's Points to determine if the club is promoted or demoted and the number of rewards. Club Ranks are the same as Power League ranks, where progression starts at Bronze I. Each Club member receives Club Coins at the end based on the performance of the club and the member, which can be used in the Club Shop.[13]
   
   Seasons
   Each season brings a new Brawl Pass and Power League. Each season is accompanied with new skins that are themed to the season.[14]
   
   Starr Road
   The Starr Road was introduced at mid season 15, introducing different rewards for the Brawl Pass, and also the removal of Brawl Boxes, which came as Brawl, Big, Mega, and Omega boxes. They would grant rewards such as power points for individual brawlers, used for upgrading them. They would also grant coins, and Brawlers, which were luck-based through their rarities, including Rare, Super Rare, Epic, Mythic, Legendary, and Chromatics, which were individually released for each Brawl Pass season, in addition to the rarity, excepting the current chromatic, which would be inaccessible unless achieving level 30, which you could unlock the Brawler if you possessed the premium Brawl Pass. The Starr Road, in compensation for the removal of boxes, introduced new features, such as credits, chroma credits and fame. Credits were accessible after completing the Brawl Pass at level 70, which allowed you to gain a set amount of credits, coins, and power points per level, which would be set to 500 tokens. They would also be gained though the daily rewards, which would often grant them. By acquiring a number of credits for each Brawler Rarity, (excepting Chromatics) could unlock them. Chroma credits, similar to credits, were obtainable through the Brawl Pass level-up rewards. Using these credits, you could unlock Chromatics, on a separate page of the Starr Road section, which was split into two, the Starr Road and Chromatics. Power points were also modified, to instead of being automatically applied to a random brawler, to being stored in your power points storage, which would cap at 4,000 points.</body>

 <h1>Development and release</h1>
 Supercell set out to develop a team based game similar to League of Legends and Overwatch. The team wanted to create such a game that was designed with mobile devices in mind first. According to Supercell's Frank Keienburg, "Our focus was on retaining a lot of depth while stripping away all the fluff."[15] Although the game contains some elements of the battle royale genre, these were implemented before the genre as a whole took off and the team did not set out to make a game with those elements.[16]
 
 The game is notable for its long soft launch period during which virtually every aspect of the game changed.[17] Supercell officially announced the game via a livestream video on June 14, 2017.[18] It received an iOS soft launch in Canada the following day.[19] The soft launch would last a total of 522 days, during which internally it was doubted whether or not the game would ever actually see a general release.[16][15] Initially the game was played in portrait mode and had players tapping on the screen, this was changed eventually to players using analog controls and playing in landscape mode.[16][15] Other changes include changing the UI, changing the metagame and transitioning the game from 2D to 3D.[15] Frank Keienburg attributes the difficult beta period to the developers working in a new genre where they "weren't sure how to interpret its success".[16] The game soft-launched in Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Ireland, Singapore, Hong Kong, Macao and Malaysia for iOS on January 19, 2018, and on June 26, 2018, Android received early access to the game as a continuation of the soft launch.[20]
 
 Brawl Stars was made globally and officially available on December 12, 2018.[4][1] It made more than US$63 million in its first month.[21] On June 9, 2020, Brawl Stars was released in Mainland China.[22]><body>
